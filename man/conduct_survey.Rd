\title{Conduct Survey
Wrapper to repeatedly run fish_population function
Give function arguments for
This function initializes the spatial distribution of the fish population}
\usage{
conduct_survey(fish_area, location_list, scope, nhooks, ndrops,
  process = "hypergeometric")
}
\arguments{
\item{fish_area}{Matrix with the distribution of fish}

\item{location_list}{list specifying rows and columns to survey in}

\item{scope}{the scope of fishing movement, default to 1 so fish in surrounding 1 cells can move in}

\item{nhooks}{number of hooks at the smallest sampling size}

\item{ndrops}{number of drops, default is 5 following hook and line protocol}

\item{process}{specify process by which fish are sampled, options are 'multinomial' and 'hypergeometric'}
