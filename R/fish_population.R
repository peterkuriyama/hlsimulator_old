#'Function to fish the population
#'@param fish_area Matrix with the distribution of fish
#'@param location Data frame of locations with column for vessel, rows, and columns of fish are to fish in. 
# '@param location list of locations specifying rows and columns of fish_area to fish in. The length of the list will correspond to the number of vessels
#'@param scope the scope of fishing movement, default to 1 so fish in surrounding 1 cells can move in
#'@param nhooks number of hooks at the smallest sampling size
#'@param ndrops number of drops, default is 5 following hook and line protocol
#'@param process specify process by which fish are sampled, options are 'multinomial', 'hypergeometric', and 'equal_prob'
